Poject Name: COINCOUNT

Abstract: CoinCount is dedicated to providing a user-friendly, comprehensive financial management solution for individuals and small businesses. Our primary aim is to simplify expense and income tracking, offering valuable insights through an interactive dashboard, while promoting financial awareness. CoinCount empowers users to easily record and categorize expenses, monitor various income sources, and receive timely reminders for essential events, such as credit card APR due dates. Our ultimate goal is to facilitate effective financial management, reduce financial stress, and help users achieve their financial objectives.

Lastweek Progress:

Last week, we enhanced button functionalities and introduced a Login/Signup page without user authentication. Implemented key features on the Home Page, enabling seamless navigation to the login/signup page when clicking "Get Started." Introduced three main navigation buttons—Insights, Features, and About—each providing detailed information about Coincount. Enhanced user experience with 'Home' buttons on every page for quick navigation. Ensured intuitive navigation across sections, allowing users to seamlessly explore insights, features, and information for a comprehensive experience.

Week 3 Progress:

This week, we successfully connected our website to an Amazon EC2 instance, implemented MySQL, and achieved user authentication. The website is now cloud-ready, storing user data in a database upon signup and displaying a Dashboard post-login.

1:Connected to Amazon EC2 for cloud-based servers.
2:Created a MySQL instance and performed necessary configurations and installations locally.
3:Ran Apache and MySQL to link the website to a cloud-based server for data storage.
4:Verified website appearance using the IP address, reflecting the design from week 2.
5:Implemented Login/Signup functionalities, storing user data in the database upon signup.
6:Confirmed form submission with a pop-up message and established successful login pop-ups.
7:Achieved user authentication and created a user profile post-successful login.

We conducted a preliminary trial of the Amazon EC2 instance mindful of cost considerations, utilizing a trial period limited to 750 hours, with excess hours incurring significant charges. To optimize expenses, we judiciously started and stopped the instance as needed. 
Snapshots capturing successful user authentication, login processes, and data storage in the database are readily available for review. 
It's important to note that attempting to run the IP address in "db.php" will yield a "404 NOT FOUND" error. This issue arises because the instance is currently in a stopped state and, consequently, not connected to the server.

Next Steps,
In the next progress report, our focus will be on developing a dashboard. This dashboard will feature a graphical representation of expenses, providing users with a visually intuitive overview of their financial data. The upcoming discussions will delve into the intricacies of designing layouts, optimizing CSS elements, and incorporating additional functionalities to enhance the overall user experience.
