Our ultimate goal is to facilitate effective financial management, reduce financial stress, and help users achieve their financial objectives.

Lastweek Progress:

Last week, we enhanced button functionalities and introduced a Login/Signup page without user authentication. Implemented key features on the Home Page, enabling seamless navigation to the login/signup page when clicking "Get Started." Introduced three main navigation buttons—Insights, Features, and About—each providing detailed information about Coincount. Enhanced user experience with 'Home' buttons on every page for quick navigation. Ensured intuitive navigation across sections, allowing users to seamlessly explore insights, features, and information for a comprehensive experience.

Week 4 Progress:

This week, significant progress has been made on the COINCOUNT project. We successfully implemented the login page in the previous week, but user authorization was initially disabled. In the current week, we focused on enabling user authentication to enhance the security of the platform. Users can now sign in, and based on their credentials, they gain access to their personalized COINCOUNT page. The system now securely stores user details for a seamless login experience.

1: User Authentication: Users can now sign in securely. Login functionality has been enabled, ensuring a personalized experience for each user.
2: User Pages: Upon logging in, each user is directed to their individual page. User-specific details and entries are now saved for future sessions.
3: Expense and Income Tabs: Two main tabs, "Expense" and "Income," have been added for streamlined financial tracking.
4: Expense Entry: In the "Expense" tab, users can input information such as expense name, amount, date, and category. The entered expenses are saved for future reference.
5: Income Entry: Similarly, in the "Income" tab, users can record income details, including source, amount, date, and any additional notes.
6: Data Management: Deletion of entries is supported. After pressing delete, a page refresh updates the information accordingly.
7: Persistent Data: User data is persistent; even after logging out and logging back in, the information remains intact.

Next Week Plan:
For the upcoming week, our focus will be on enhancing the user experience through the implementation of a dashboard feature. The dashboard will provide users with a graphical representation of their overall expenses, allowing for a more insightful understanding of their financial patterns.
